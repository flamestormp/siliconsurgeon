                    Is your phone running more slowly than it was last year? Is the battery running out before
                    your day is done? Too many background services draining your precious data? Another
                    miscellanneous problem you might have?
                    We can help! We can run up to fifty different specialized, in-house designed tests
                    to find exactly what's wrong with your device. Then we can fix it for you,
                    or point you in the right direction for a solution in the rare case that we can't.</p>
                <p>
                    We also do physical repairs for mobile devices. If your phone has suffered from a drop or is
                    experiencing a dead pixel, bring it in and we can replace that broken screen for you!
