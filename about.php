                <p><strong> Dr. Phillip H. Nguyen </strong></p>
                <p> He may look young, but the sum of his experiences make up a lifetime.
                    Specialized in forensic data recovery and network traffic
                    analysis, but later moved on to study computer science. After a long
                    and successful career as a programmer at several companies, he decided
                    to go back to his roots and work on repairing consumer electronics.
                    Phillip always shows passion and dedication in all his endeavors, but
                    Silicon Surgeon is only the next step in his grand mission.

                <p><strong> Prof. Liam E. Beliveau </strong></p>
                <p> A keen eye and a sharp intuition makes this fellow the enemy of all bugs.
                    His gut is second to none when it comes to the art of problem solving.
                    After teaching Information Technology and Computer Science at the
                    University of Vermont for over a decade, he decided that the classroom
                    wasn't where he wanted to be. He was always the curious type, disassembling
                    computers since the early age of four! Silicon Surgeon exists today because
                    his sixth sense did him well during a trip to Vegas.
